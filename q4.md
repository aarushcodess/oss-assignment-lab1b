# Documentation for Dijkstra-OpenMP

## Overview

This file implements Dijkstra's algorithm using OpenMP for parallelism. The algorithm computes the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

## Functions

### `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`

**Purpose:**  
The entry point of the program. Parses command-line arguments, initializes the graph, and runs the Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Parameters:**
- `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
- `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.

**Returns:**
- `int`: Returns 0 on successful execution.

**Description:**
1. Reads input from a file or standard input.
2. Initializes the graph and distance arrays.
3. Calls the `dijkstra` function.
4. Outputs the results.

### `void dijkstra(int **graph, int *dist, int *prev, int num_vertices, int start_vertex)`

**Purpose:**  
Computes the shortest paths from the `start_vertex` to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Parameters:**
- `graph`: An adjacency matrix representing the graph.
- `dist`: An array to store the shortest distances from the start vertex.
- `prev`: An array to store the previous vertex in the shortest path.
- `num_vertices`: The total number of vertices in the graph.
- `start_vertex`: The starting vertex for the algorithm.

**Returns:**
- `void`

**Description:**
1. Initializes distance and previous arrays.
2. Uses OpenMP parallel regions to update distances.
3. Iterates over vertices to compute shortest paths.

### `void initialize_graph(int **graph, int num_vertices)`

**Purpose:**  
Initializes the graph with given number of vertices.

**Parameters:**
- `graph`: A pointer to the graph matrix.
- `num_vertices`: The number of vertices in the graph.

**Returns:**
- `void`

**Description:**
Allocates memory for the graph matrix and initializes it with edge weights.

### `void print_results(int *dist, int *prev, int num_vertices)`

**Purpose:**  
Prints the shortest paths and distances from the start vertex.

**Parameters:**
- `dist`: An array with shortest distances.
- `prev`: An array with previous vertices in the shortest path.
- `num_vertices`: The total number of vertices in the graph.

**Returns:**
- `void`

**Description:**
Outputs the computed shortest paths and distances to the console.

## Parallelism with OpenMP

The `dijkstra` function uses OpenMP constructs to parallelize the relaxation of edges. Key constructs include:
- `#pragma omp parallel for`: To parallelize loops over vertices and edges.
- `#pragma omp critical`: To handle critical sections where shared resources are updated.
